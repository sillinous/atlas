**Recipe ID:** CA-001  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Yield:** 1 × 10-inch cheesecake (12 slices)  
**Prep Time:** 45 minutes  
**Bake Time:** 1 hour 15 minutes  
**Total Time:** 6+ hours (including cooling)

### INGREDIENT SPECIFICATION

#### Crust
| Ingredient | Weight | Volume (approx) | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Graham cracker crumbs | 200g | 1.5 cups | Fine grind |
| Granulated sugar | 50g | ¼ cup | |
| Unsalted butter, melted | 85g | 6 tbsp | Room temp |
| Salt | 2g | ¼ tsp | Fine |

#### Filling
| Ingredient | Weight | Volume (approx) | Notes |
|------------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| Cream cheese | 900g | 32 oz (4 blocks) | Full fat, room temp |
| Granulated sugar | 250g | 1¼ cups | |
| Sour cream | 240g | 1 cup | Full fat, room temp |
| Heavy cream | 120ml | ½ cup | 36% fat minimum |
| Vanilla extract | 15ml | 1 tbsp | Pure, not imitation |
| Fresh lemon juice | 15ml | 1 tbsp | Freshly squeezed |
| Lemon zest | 5g | 1 tsp | Microplaned |
| Large eggs | 4 whole | ~200g | Room temperature |
| Egg yolks | 2 | ~36g | Room temperature |
| All-purpose flour | 30g | ¼ cup | Sifted |
| Salt | 3g | ½ tsp | Fine |

### EQUIPMENT REQUIRED
- 10-inch springform pan
- Large roasting pan (for water bath)
- Stand mixer with paddle attachment
- Rubber spatula
- Microplane zester
- Digital thermometer
- Kitchen scale (critical)
- Aluminum foil (heavy duty)

### PROCEDURE

#### Phase 1: Crust Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C)
2. Wrap exterior of springform pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil (water bath protection)
3. Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt in bowl
4. Add melted butter, mix until evenly moistened
5. Press firmly into bottom and 1 inch up sides of pan
6. Bake 10 minutes until set and lightly golden
7. Cool completely before filling

**CRITICAL CONTROL POINT:** Crust must be fully cooled or filling will not set properly at edges

#### Phase 2: Filling Preparation
1. Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature (68-72°F)
2. Beat cream cheese on medium-low speed for 3 minutes until completely smooth
   - Scrape bowl frequently
   - No lumps should remain
3. Add sugar gradually, beat 2 minutes
4. Add sour cream and heavy cream, beat 1 minute
5. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and lemon zest, beat 30 seconds
6. Add eggs and yolks ONE AT A TIME, beating just until incorporated after each
   - Overmixing incorporates air → cracks
7. Add flour and salt, mix on lowest speed just until combined
8. Scrape bowl, give 10 final stirs by hand with spatula

**CRITICAL CONTROL POINT:** Never beat at high speed after adding eggs. Air bubbles cause cracking.

#### Phase 3: Baking
1. Pour filling into cooled crust
2. Tap pan firmly on counter 5 times to release air bubbles
3. Place springform in roasting pan
4. Add hot water to roasting pan (1 inch depth)
5. Bake at 325°F for 1 hour 15 minutes
   - Cheesecake is done when edges are set but center jiggles slightly
   - Internal temp should reach 150°F
6. Turn off oven, crack door 1 inch
7. Let cheesecake cool in oven for 1 hour

**CRITICAL CONTROL POINT:** Sudden temperature change causes cracking. Gradual cooling is essential.

#### Phase 4: Cooling and Setting
1. Remove from oven, remove from water bath
2. Cool at room temperature for 1 hour
3. Run thin knife around edge to release from pan
4. Refrigerate minimum 4 hours, preferably overnight
5. Remove springform ring before serving

### QUALITY CHECKPOINTS

| Checkpoint | Standard | Acceptable Range |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| Crust color | Light golden | Pale to medium golden |
| Filling surface | Smooth, minimal cracks | Hairline cracks acceptable |
| Center jiggle | 2-inch diameter wobble | 1-3 inch |
| Internal temp | 150°F | 145-155°F |
| Texture | Creamy, dense, smooth | No graininess |
| Flavor | Tangy, sweet, vanilla notes | Balanced |

### SCALING FACTORS

| Yield | Multiplier | Pan Size | Bake Time Adjustment |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 cake | 1.0× | 10" | Standard |
| 2 cakes | 2.0× | 2 × 10" | +10 minutes |
| 6" mini | 0.4× | 6" | -20 minutes |
| 4" individual | 0.15× | 4" | -35 minutes |
| Sheet pan | 3.0× | 18×13" | +15 minutes |

### STORAGE
- Refrigerated: 5 days maximum
- Frozen (undecorated): 2 months
- Thaw in refrigerator overnight

### COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Cracked top | Overbaking, sudden temp change | Reduce time, gradual cooling |
| Dense/heavy | Overmixing, cold ingredients | Mix less, room temp ingredients |
| Grainy texture | Sugar not dissolved | Beat cream cheese longer first |
| Wet/soggy bottom | Water bath leak | Double foil wrap |
| Sinks in center | Underbaked | Increase time, check internal temp |
| Brown top | Oven too hot | Reduce temp, use water bath |

| Salt | 3g | |

### EQUIPMENT
- 9-inch springform pan (3" tall minimum)

- Stand mixer
- Rubber spatula

### PROCEDURE

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C)
2. Line springform pan with parchment, allowing 2-inch overhang above rim
3. Beat cream cheese until smooth (3 minutes)
4. Add sugar, beat 2 minutes
5. Add eggs one at a time, mixing well after each
6. Add cream, vanilla, salt - mix until combined
7. Add flour, mix just until incorporated
8. Strain batter through fine sieve (removes lumps)
9. Pour into prepared pan

    - Center should wobble significantly
    - Top should be very dark brown/almost black in spots
11. Cool in pan at room temperature
12. Refrigerate minimum 4 hours

**CRITICAL CONTROL POINT:** The burnt appearance is intentional. The caramelization creates signature flavor.

### QUALITY CHECKPOINTS

| Checkpoint | Standard |
|------------|----------|
| Top color | Deep brown to nearly black patches |
